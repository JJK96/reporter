= Reporter

This project can be used to create a penetration test report based on findings and some extra report content. 
The findings and issue content are merged and inserted into a LaTeX template. This template is them compiled to PDF.

== Setup

Use python 3.10.

Clone https://github.com/JJK96/textile_parser and install using `pip install -e .`

Clone this project using `git clone --recurse-submodules`. Then install the project using `pip install -e .`.

=== Dependencies

Install basictex to have the necessary tools to compile LaTeX: `brew install --cask basictex`

In order to use the provided functionality for creating standard issues, the program https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] should be installed.

To use diffing of standard issues and report issues, `diff` is required.

To use the provided tooling for editing, installing Visual Studio Code is recommended, but not required.

==== Mac OS

    brew install --cask basictex
    brew install fzf

==== Ubuntu

    sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-luatex latexmk fonts-open-sans

Make sure you have at least texlive-luatex version 2021.20220204, so that lua-ul.sty is included.

== Usage

=== Creating a new report

To create a new report, use the following command:

```
reporter init <report_name>
reporter init -l nl <report_name>
```

This will create a new directory with the name <report_name> with the LaTeX template "report.tex" and the directory "issues" with one example issue. This new project is created based on the `report_init` directory.

=== Adding report content

==== Report settings

The settings for the report can be edited in `reporter.ini`. These settings include the preferred language, title of the report, company name, etc.

==== Report content

Other report content can be added in `report.tex`, the file should be self-explanatory.

==== Issue

The report can be created by adding new issues to the issue directory. Each issue has it's own directory, with an arbitrary name. In the directory, the issue file should have a name that starts with "issue" or ends with ".issue". All other files in the directory are interpreted as evidence.

To aid in creating an issue the command `create-issue` (alias `ci`) is provided:

```
reporter create-issue --title "This is the title"
```

It is also possible to easily create an issue based on an issue from the standard issue library.

```
reporter create-standard-issue
```

This opens `fzf` with all the files in the standard issue library. There one issue can be selected. This issue is then copied to the `issues` directory.

==== Evidence

To aid in creating a new evidence, the command `create-evidence` (alias `ce`) is provided:

```
reporter create-evidence <location> <output-file>
```

This will create a new evidence with the given location (hostname) and store it in the given output file.

==== Paths

To ensure that paths are formatted correctly, wrap them in the LaTeX command `\path{...}`

==== Images

To add an image, store it in the folder `images` in the report and insert the `\image{...}` command.

Example:

```
$ ls images
test_image.png
```

Then anywhere in the report:

```
\image{test_image}
```

==== Pentesting tools

To avoid having to put pentesting tools with footnotes everywhere in the report, there is a framework for managing pentesting tools.
The description of the tools are added in the `static_content` of the report.
Through `tools.tex`, the tool definitions are inserted in the report.

If a tools is used in evidence, it can be referred to using `\tool{toolname}`.
This will insert a reference to the tool description in the place of the tool.

The appendix of the report will contain a list of all the tools used, including their descriptions and URLs.

A tool can be manually declared with

    \declaretool[link]{toolname}{description}

=== Compiling the report

The report can be compiled with the following command:

```
reporter generate
```

This creates the directory `.cache/output` with all the files necessary for compilation, compiles the report and copies the resulting PDF report to the current directory.

=== Tooling

Reports created with the `reporter init` command contain a `.vscode` directory with settings for Visual Studio Code. These settings suggest some plugins for LaTeX editing and compiling, textile support, spelling checking and code review tools. The following popup is shown when VS Code is started.

Installing the plugins is recommended. The LaTeX report can be compiled by clicking the green arrow when editing the `report.tex` file.

== How it works

On a high level, the application uses a LaTeX Jinja template and several sources of information provided through either a given template or a given report to compile a PDF file.

The directory `templates` contains several report templates. A template contains the content and templates for a report. The default template `templates/default` is used as a fallback for files that have not been overridden in other templates.
A template contains the following information:

* The LaTeX template in `./report`. The LaTeX template contains no text, all text is loaded using jinja. 
* Static images in `./static_images`, these images can be used by the template
* Static content in `./static_content`, this content contains text and placeholders that will be used during jinja templating. Based on the selected language, the correct static content is loaded.
* Dynamic content based on issues, such as counts, summaries, etc.
* Dynamic content in `./dynamic_text.py`, this Python module is optionally included and can be used to add information to the jinja context using Python scripts.
* `./reporter.py` can be used to override the Reporter class in `reporter/reporter.py` for advanced customization.

In addition to the information provided by the template, information from the report is added:

* `./report.tex` contains user-provided information that should be added to the report
* `./reporter.ini` contains user-provided settings for the report, including the title and customer name
* Issues and evidences. The directory `issues` in a report contains all issues and evidences for the report. These issues are parsed and merged with the jinja context.

=== Compilation steps

The steps for compiling the report are as follows:

1. Create the `.cache` directory in which the report is built.
2. Symlink all files in the report directory to the `.cache/output` directory.
3. Copy all LaTeX templates and store them in the `.cache/templates` directory.
4. Template all LaTeX templates in `.cache/templates` and store the output in `.cache/output`.
5. Copy the necessary supportive files. These files are stored in `necessary_files` and contain a Makefile used to build the project and some other necessary files.
6. Run Make in the `.cache/output` directory to build the report
7. Copy the report PDF file to the report directory.

=== Overriding LaTeX templates

When copying the template files to `.cache/templates`, the LaTeX templates are loaded first from parent themes/templates, then from the template itself, and finally from the report directory. 
his means that it is possible to override any of the LaTeX templates by copying it from `.cache/templates` to the report directory and editing it.
These files may contain Jinja tags (`\BLOCK{...}` and `\VAR{...}`).

Extra content can be loaded from `.yaml` files in the report directory.
e.g.

`content.yaml`
```
some_variable: test
```

`conclusion.tex`
```
\VAR{some_variable}
```

=== Dradis/Textile parsing

For Textile parsing of Dradis content https://github.com/JJK96/textile_parser[Textile-Parser] is used. This library parses a Dradis file and returns a dictionary containing all fields. The markup in the fields, like bullets, footnotes, etc. is converted to LaTeX and is inserted directly in the resulting Dradis Issue.

==== Non-standard issue fields:

    #[Number]#
    4

Normally, issues are numbered from 1 to n starting with the highest-severity vulnerability as 1.
It is possible to override this automatic number for specific issues by setting the `number` field in the issue.

    #[Label]#
    mylabel

To refer to an issue somewhere else in the text, the `label` field can be used to set a label.
It can then be used to reference the issue somewhere in the text using `\ref{mylabel}`.

    #[Location]#
    server1, server2

Normally the location where an issue is found is determined as the combination of the locations of all evidences.
This can be overriden by setting the `location` field in the issue.

=== Report initiation

When running `reporter init`, the `report_init` directory is used to create a new report. A template is loaded and files in the directory are templated using jinja, based on the static content in the template.

=== The LaTeX template

The latex template is stored in the `templates/default/report/` folder. The heart of the template is the `report.cls` latex class file. This file contains all kinds of commands and macro's to simplify the syntax for creating a latex support. It defines the colors for different risk levels of risks. It also defines the title page format and uses variables to fill the variable content.

==== Custom templates

It is possible to extend or override the existing template by creating a new template in the `templates` folder. Any file in `templates/new_template/report` will override a file with the same name in `templates/default/report`.
The directory `static_images` can be created in a report. These images are copied to the `.cache/output` folder in any new reports.

In addition, it is possible to add a file for generating dynamic content. To do this, create a file named `dynamic_text.py` in the directory of the new template. This file should contain a content like the following:

----
from reporter.dynamic_text import Generator


class English(Generator):
    def generate(self):
        self.content['anything'] = "This dynamically created value"

generators = {
    "en": English,
}
----

It is also possible to extend the reporter class. For this, add a file named `reporter.py` in the directory of the new template. This file should contain a content like the following:

----
from reporter.reporter import Reporter as Base


class Reporter(Base):
    ...
    def process_issues(self, content, issues):
        """Do something with the content based on the issues"""
    ...
----

===== Issue

For creating an issue, the `issue` environment is available. This environment is normally filled based on the Textile formatted issue and evidence files. The format is described below.

----
\begin{issue}
\descriptionfield{Thes issue is ... }
\solution{You should ... }
\location{Hostname.domain}
\cvss{0.0}
\cvssvector{CVSS3.1:AV/N...}

\begin{evidence}{Hostname}
